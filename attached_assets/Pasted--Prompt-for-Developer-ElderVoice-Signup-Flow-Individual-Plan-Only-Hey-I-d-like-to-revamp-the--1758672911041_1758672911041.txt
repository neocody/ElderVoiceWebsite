🔧 Prompt for Developer: ElderVoice Signup Flow (Individual Plan Only)

Hey! I’d like to revamp the signup flow based on a new structure modeled after Meela.ai, but with improvements and our own voice. There’s only one pricing plan for now, so keep that in mind — no plan selector needed.

🔑 Core Requirements:

Only one public plan (e.g., 3-day free trial → $19.95/mo subscription, billed via Stripe)

Signup flow must branch based on user type:

“Myself”

“A loved one”

“Care Facility” (this one just leads to a contact form for now)

✅ Signup Flow Overview
🔹 STEP 1: “Who is ElderVoice for?”

Buttons:

"Myself"

"A loved one"

"Care Facility"

🧠 “Care Facility” route can go to a standalone “Request a Demo” form — keep the rest of the flow for “Myself” and “Loved One” only.

🔹 STEP 2: Verification

Prompt for phone number (SMS verification) or email login (magic link) — use whichever is easier to implement

Once verified, auto-login the user

🔹 STEP 3: Collect Personal Info
For “Myself” flow:

Name

ZIP Code (validate)

Date of Birth (must be 18+)

Checkbox: [ ] I accept the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (link out)

For “Loved One” flow:

What should we call them? (nickname)

ZIP Code (validate)

Date of Birth (must be 18+)

Relationship to them (optional)

Same Terms/Privacy checkbox

🔹 STEP 4: Personalization
For “Myself”:

Prompt: “Tell us a bit about yourself so ElderVoice can personalize your conversations”

Free-text box with optional prompt examples (e.g., “I love gardening”, “My grandkids call me Gigi”)

For “Loved One”:

Same idea — free-text about the person being signed up

🔹 STEP 5: Call Preferences

Days of the week to receive calls (toggle or checkbox Mon–Sun)

Preferred time of day (dropdown: Morning / Afternoon / Evening)

🔹 STEP 6: Checkout (Stripe)

3-day free trial, then $19.95/month

Collect billing info via Stripe (can use prebuilt Checkout if easier)

Show secure badge, recurring billing acknowledgment:

“By clicking Subscribe, you agree to be billed monthly after your free trial. You may cancel anytime.”

🔹 STEP 7: Post-Signup Success Page
For “Myself”:

“You’re all set! Your first call is scheduled for [date/time]”

For “Loved One”:

Display a message:

“Your subscription is active, but we need to confirm consent from [name] before we begin calling.”

Offer options for verification:

Text message to the loved one

Email

Or a call from ElderVoice support (placeholder for now)

📲 Notes & UX Reminders:

Mobile-first responsive layout

Validate all inputs (ZIP, DOB, email format, phone, etc.)

Use clean, modern UI (you can use Tailwind, shadcn/ui, or any open-source component set)

Use the current service plan logic — no need to build a plan selector

Stripe integration must:

Create a customer

Apply 3-day trial

Subscribe to correct plan

Save Stripe customer_id, subscription_id, and payment method to the user record
