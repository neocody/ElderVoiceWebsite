Goal: Replace the current 3-icon features row with a two-part “Value + Proof” section that includes a narrative block, a small audio demo, a human image, a testimonial, and three proof cards. Keep colors #2962EB/#4E48E6. No em dashes.

Layout

Value row (split layout)

Left:

Eyebrow: “A friendly call that fits their day”

H2: “A real conversation that brightens the week”

Short paragraph (2–3 lines).

Checklist (3 items with check icons).

AudioChip: small pill button “▶ Hear a 20-sec sample” with timecode; on play, show tiny waveform and pause. Keyboard + screen-reader accessible.

Right: rounded image card (photo or illustration of a warm phone call). Soft shadow, gentle gradient background.

Proof row

Centered testimonial card with quote, name, relation, city.

Three proof cards underneath (equal width on desktop, stacked on mobile):

Replace numbers with your real data once ready. For now, use neutral claims or “From early families”.

Microcopy (drop-in)

Eyebrow: A friendly call that fits their day

H2: A real conversation that brightens the week
