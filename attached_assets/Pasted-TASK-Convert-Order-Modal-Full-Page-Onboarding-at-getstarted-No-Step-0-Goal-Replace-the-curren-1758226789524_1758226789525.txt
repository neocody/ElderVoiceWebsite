TASK: Convert Order Modal → Full Page Onboarding at /getstarted (No Step 0)

Goal
Replace the current order-form pop-up with a fast, mobile-first onboarding flow at /getstarted. Keep the existing plan-select buttons elsewhere; they should deep-link to /getstarted?plan=starter|family etc. No tier picker on this page.

Flow (V1, card-first)

Step 1 — Create Account

Step 2 — Start Free Trial (Stripe)

Step 3 — Welcome

Step 4 — Add Loved One (minimum)

Step 5 — Who Gets Texts?

Step 6 — Test & Finish

(Optional drawer after finish: “Make calls feel like them” mini-profile — skippable)

ROUTE & LAYOUT

New route: /getstarted (public, not indexed).

Desktop: centered container, max-width ~640px.

Mobile: 1-column, sticky footer with primary CTA.

Progress header with step labels (1–6). Allow back/forward within this flow only.

STEP 1 — Create Your Account

Fields (required)

Full name

Email

Mobile (for alerts)

Time zone (auto-detect; editable dropdown)

Consent (checkbox, required)
“I agree to the Terms & Privacy and consent to receive SMS about my ElderVoice account (alerts, reminders, support). Reply STOP to opt out.”

Buttons

Primary: Continue

Secondary: “Already have an account? Sign in”

Validation

Name/email/phone required; inline errors.

Format phone to E.164; show example.

Copy (top)
“No app needed for your parent. You can set up the first call in ~1 minute.”

STEP 2 — Start Free Trial (Stripe)

Plan

Read plan from querystring; default to starter. (No plan chooser on this page.)

Show summary badge: “Plan: {{Plan name}} • Includes {{patient_limit}} patient{{s}}”

Text
“14-day free trial. Then $14/mo per patient on {{Plan}}. Cancel anytime. We’ll remind you before your trial ends on {{trial_end_date}}.”

Action

Open Stripe Checkout (subscription; trial).

On success: return to /getstarted?step=welcome&session_id=… and create an active trial in the app.

On fail/cancel: stay on Step 2 with a friendly error.

Error copy
“We couldn’t start your trial with that card. Please try another.”

STEP 3 — Welcome

Header
“You’re in. Let’s set up your loved one (≈1 minute).”

Body

Primary: Add a loved one now

Secondary: Do this later (adds dashboard banner; no calls until a patient exists)

STEP 4 — Add Loved One (Minimum to Run)

Fields (required)

Preferred name (how we address them)

Phone (mobile or landline)

Call window (8–10am • 9–11am • 10–12pm; default 9–11am)

Consent (required)
“I have permission for ElderVoice to call {{Preferred name}} with automated daily check-ins.”

Plan usage hint
“This loved one will be added to your {{Plan}} ({{used}}/{{limit}}).”

Buttons

Primary: Save & continue

Secondary: Skip for now

Limit handling
If used == limit → show modal:
“You’ve used all patient slots on {{Plan}}. Upgrade to add another.” [See plans]

STEP 5 — Who Gets Texts?

Default

Sponsor pre-checked for Alerts and 6pm Summary.

Add contact (optional, max 2 for V1)

Name, Mobile

Toggles: Alerts / 6pm Summary

TCPA opt-in (automatic)
When a contact is added, send:
“{{Sponsor}} listed you for ElderVoice updates about {{Elder}}. Reply YES to confirm, HELP for help, STOP to stop.”
Only contacts who reply YES receive messages.

Buttons

Primary: Continue

Secondary: Skip for now

Inline note
“Contacts can be added anytime.”

STEP 6 — Test & Finish

Actions

Call me now (places a test check-in to sponsor)

Send sample alert (SMS to sponsor)

Preview
“Tonight’s 6pm summary will look like:
‘ElderVoice: {{Elder}} — OK / Needed help (resolved at 3:14pm) / Didn’t answer (you were notified).’”

Delivery failure banners

“We couldn’t reach this number. [Fix number]”

If SMS undeliverable, block finish until updated.

Finish

Primary: Looks good → Go to Dashboard

OPTIONAL DRAWER AFTER FINISH — “Make Calls Feel Like Them” (Skippable)

Address as: input (Mr./Mrs./Grandma Jean/first name)

Tone: Friendly / Formal / Brief

Language: English / Spanish / Other

Hearing/Pace: Normal / Slow & clear / Louder & slower (Repeat options On/Off)

Escalation if no answer twice: Sponsor only / All contacts / Try one more call later today

Topics they enjoy: Family • Pets • Garden • Weather • Faith • Hobbies (free text)
Buttons: Save • Skip

Show a light nudge on Dashboard if skipped: “Add a little personality to {{Elder}}’s calls → 60s”

SYSTEM BEHAVIOR (high level, non-technical)

After Stripe success: mark trial active and attach chosen plan (with patient slots).

Calls/SMS only run when a plan is active and at least one loved one exists.

Contacts must reply YES before receiving any messages. Sponsor always receives alerts/summary.

“Resolve” links are one-tap (no login).

COPY (PASTE EXACTLY)

Call script (elder):
“Hi, this is ElderVoice with your daily check-in for {{Preferred name}}.
Press 1 if you’re OK.
Press 2 if you need help.
Press 3 if you’d like a call later today.”

Alert SMS (sponsor/contacts):
“ElderVoice: {{Elder}} didn’t answer their check-in. Please check and tap to resolve: {{resolve_link}}”

6pm summary SMS:
“ElderVoice: {{Elder}} — {{OK / Needed help (resolved at {{time}}) / Didn’t answer (you were notified)}}.”

Upgrade banner (limit reached):
“You’ve used all patient slots on your plan. Upgrade to add another.” [See plans]

Inactive plan banner:
“Your plan isn’t active. Calls and texts are paused.” [Manage plan]

ACCESSIBILITY & MOBILE

Labels linked to inputs; error text announced to screen readers.

44px touch targets; numeric keypad for phone fields.

Works fully on 360px width.

ANALYTICS (events to log)

getstarted_step_viewed {step}

signup_submitted / signup_failed

checkout_started / checkout_completed

patient_added

contact_added / contact_optin_yes

test_call_triggered / sample_alert_sent

onboarding_finished

DEPRECATE OLD MODAL

Replace all “Start Trial” triggers to link to /getstarted?plan={{id}}.

Remove/disable the legacy pop-up.

If someone lands on old hash/route, redirect 301 → /getstarted.

QA / ACCEPTANCE (must pass)

Complete Steps 1→6 on mobile in <3 minutes.

“Call me now” rings within 30s; “Sample alert” arrives.

Contacts only receive messages after replying YES.

Dashboard shows plan name, status, patients used/allowed.

Attempting to add beyond plan limit shows upgrade prompt (no silent failure).

If plan is inactive/past-due, dashboard banner blocks calls and points to “Manage plan.”

TIMING

Implement Steps 1–6 and redirect in one pass.

Optional mini-profile drawer can ship as V1.1 if needed.
