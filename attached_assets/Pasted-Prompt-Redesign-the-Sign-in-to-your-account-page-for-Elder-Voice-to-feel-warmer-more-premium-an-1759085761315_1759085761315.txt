Prompt:
Redesign the “Sign in to your account” page for Elder Voice to feel warmer, more premium, and more accessible—optimized for caregivers and facilities. Use React + Tailwind. Keep it fast and uncluttered.

Layout

Two-column on desktop, single-column on mobile/tablet.

Left panel (brand/benefits): Soft vertical gradient using #2962EB → #4E48E6, subtle pattern. Small logo, headline “A calmer way to check in,” 3 bullet benefits (Companionship, Simple scheduling, Private & secure). Optional grayscale photo or illustration of a friendly senior on a call (no overlays).

Right panel (auth): Centered card with rounded-2xl, soft shadow, 24px padding min.

Auth Card

Title: “Sign in to your account”

Inputs: Email + Password with visible labels, helpful placeholders, and a Show/Hide password toggle.

“Remember me” checkbox; “Forgot your password?” link.

Primary button: “Sign in” (full-width). Disabled + spinner state while submitting.

Divider “or continue with” then a Sign in with Google button styled as an outline pill; include Google icon.

Small text under card: “Don’t have an account? Sign up” (link).

Inline error handling: red border, concise helper text under the field, and an alert banner at top on generic errors.

Header/Footer

On this page, simplify header to only logo (hide top nav, remove duplicate “Sign In” button).

Footer with tiny links: Privacy, Terms, Support.

Accessibility & UX

Minimum 16px body text; buttons ≥44px tall; clear focus states.

High contrast; ensure WCAG AA for text on gradients.

Keyboard-navigable; ARIA labels for inputs and error messages.

Pressing Enter submits; keep the user on the page and show validation if fields are empty/invalid.

Microcopy

Friendly, concise tone.

Beneath the password field, a tiny note: “We never share your email.”

Optional tooltip icon near the footer: “Calls may be recorded to improve conversations. Transcripts aren’t viewable by staff.”

Visual Details

Colors: primary #2962EB, accent #4E48E6, neutrals in cool gray range.

Rounded corners (lg–2xl), soft shadows, plenty of white space.

Icons: outline style, minimal.

Empty/Error States

Show a generic “Incorrect email or password” banner on 401.

Rate-limit friendly copy if too many attempts.

Success/Loading

On submit: disable button + spinner + “Signing you in…” text.

After success: fade/slide transition to dashboard.

Deliverables

A responsive React component with Tailwind classes.

Separate <AuthHeader />, <AuthCard />, and <BrandPanel /> subcomponents.

Example states: default, field error, loading, and mobile layout.

Nice-to-haves (if quick)

Support for future SSO buttons (Apple/Microsoft) behind a config flag.

Basic unit tests for validation and disabled states.
