REVISION BRIEF — Services & Patients (simple, human version)
Goal

Make “Service plan” the container and “Patients” live inside it.

You cannot have a patient without a service plan, and a service plan isn’t considered “active” until at least one patient is added (and the plan’s patient limit isn’t exceeded).

Core Rules (business logic)

A customer (sponsor/admin) buys/starts a service plan first.

Each service plan includes an allowed number of patients (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.).

Patients and all their info belong to a specific service plan.

If the plan is inactive, paused, or past due, all related patient services are paused (no calls/texts).

If the plan is at its patient limit, the app clearly asks the user to upgrade before adding more patients.

UX Changes (what the user sees)

On the client profile:

Rename “Services” to “Plan” and show: Plan name, Status (Active/Trial/Paused), and a counter like “2 of 3 patients used.”

“Upgrade plan” button if maxed out.

Patients Section:

“Add patient” works only if there’s room left in the plan.

If full: show banner “You’ve used all slots on your plan. Upgrade to add more.” with an Upgrade button.

Each patient clearly shows which plan they belong to.

Flow (from sign-up to live)

Sign up / Start Trial → user picks a plan (or default starter) and starts it.

Add first patient (required to make the plan useful).

If user tries to add more patients than the plan allows → show upgrade prompt.

If billing fails or plan is paused → clearly display “Plan inactive—services paused” and point to billing.

Copy to use (paste directly)

Plan card: “Plan: Starter • Status: Active • Patients: 2 / 3 used.”

Limit reached banner: “You’ve used all patient slots on your plan. Upgrade to add another patient.” [Upgrade plan]

Inactive plan banner: “Your plan isn’t active. Calls and texts are paused.” [Manage plan]

Add patient modal (footer note): “This patient will be added to your current plan.”

Upgrade nudge (when adding beyond limit): “Your current plan includes {{limit}} patients. Upgrade to continue.”

Admin Controls (simple)

Ability to create/edit plans with a name, description, price, and patient allowance.

Toggle a plan Active/Inactive for sale.

See usage: number of patients used per client vs. allowance.

Edge Cases (what to do)

Plan canceled or past due: pause services for all linked patients; show a clear banner and a “Reactivate” path.

Downgrading to fewer patient slots: if the customer has more patients than the new allowance, require them to remove or move patients before confirming the downgrade (show a list and a count).

Deleting a patient: frees up a slot immediately.

Trial plan ends: if not activated, pause services and show “Trial ended—activate to continue.”

Success Checklist (acceptance)

I cannot add a patient until a plan is started.

When I add a patient, I can see the used/allowed counter update.

When I hit the limit, I’m stopped with a friendly prompt to Upgrade—no confusing errors.

If my plan is inactive, the product clearly says services are paused and shows me how to fix it.

On the client profile, it’s always obvious which plan I’m on and how many patient slots remain.

“Why we’re doing this” (one line for the team)

We’re removing confusion and preventing “orphan” records by making plan → patients a clear, simple relationship that mirrors how we sell and support the product.
